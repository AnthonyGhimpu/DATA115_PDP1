# Motivation
-The question that I set out to answer would be my personal wonder if the amount of extremely high temperatures in each county in Washington has any relationship with wildfires that took place in our state from 2009 - 2013. I chose to go with two datasets from thee Washington State Department of Health and went with the # of extreme hot days in each county as well as the # of wildfires in each county from 2009 - 2013. Oregon's wildfires that happened in September made me curious on the causes of wildfires in general, and if the global climate has anything to do with it, more specifically, the amount of extremely hot days. I decided to use our local data from our state to see if there is any relationship between the two variables, and if they correlate.
