# Motivation
-The question that I set out to answer would be my personal wonder if the amount of extremely high temperatures in each county in Washington has any relationship with wildfires that took place in our state from 2009 - 2013. I chose to go with two datasets from thee Washington State Department of Health and went with the # of extreme hot days in each county as well as the # of wildfires in each county from 2009 - 2013. Oregon's wildfires that happened in September made me curious on the causes of wildfires in general, and if the global climate has anything to do with it, more specifically, the amount of extremely hot days. I decided to use our local data from our state to see if there is any relationship between the two variables, and if they correlate.  

# Data Sources
I combined two datasets from the Washington State Department of Health website and stumbled upon groupings for the # of extremely hot days per census block from 2009 - 2013 and the amount of wildfires in each county from 2009 - 2013. The derivation for the # of extremely hot days is based on the "number of days each year from 2000 onward that the maximum temperature exceeded the 99th percentile threshold at each station." The derivation for the # of wildfires is just the sum of all the wildfires that have occured in each county. I downloaded 5 different datasets per year for the # of extremely hot days (all merged) and 1 dataset for wildfires per county, all fitting within the yearly parameters.
